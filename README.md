# Hellion

Hellion is a FlyForFun V15 emulator built with C# and using the .NET Framework 4.5 and later .NET Core 1.0.

This project has been created for learning purposes about the network and game logic problematics on the server-side.

We choose to use the [Ether.Network][ethernetwork] because it provides a clients management system and also a robust packet management system entirely customisable.

## Details

- Language: `C#`
- Framework target : `.NET Core 1.0`
- Application type: `Console`
- Database type : `MySQL`
- External libraries used:
	- [Ether.Network][ethernetwork]
	- EntityFrameworkCore

## Project architecture

This section will be updated when the project structure is established.

## How to use

The current version of Hellion doesn't allow any preview. This section will be updated when the emulator will be capable of handling real players.
