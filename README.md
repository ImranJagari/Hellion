# Hellion

Hellion is a FlyForFun V15 emulator built with C# and using .NET Core to target Windows and Linux operating systems.

This project has been created for learning purposes about the network and game logic problematics on the server-side.

We choose to use the [Ether.Network][ethernetwork] because it provides a client management system and also a robust packet management system entirely customisable
